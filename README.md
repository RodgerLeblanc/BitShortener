BitShortener(beginner)
=========

This BB10 app is a Bit.ly client. Use at your own risk!
Features :
- Compatible with 10.2 and up (can be compatible with 10.0 if you want, I don't have API lower than 10.2 installed)
- Complete rewrite, tried to use the best coding practice I know (SIGNAL/SLOT, Q_PROPERTY, property, classes, custom QML components, #define, etc.)
- Added 'About', 'More Apps' and 'Settings' options
- Touch keyboard users can change tab by swiping either left or right on their keyboard
- At first run only, SystemToast will tell users with a touch enabled keyboard they can swipe between tabs
- 10.3 users can change the theme immediatly without an app restart
- Active frame support (no small active frame for Passport, waiting for Derek' explanation on how to do this with a 10.2 build)
- Font size is customizable for main app and active frame
- Connects to UpFront
- Connects to ConsoleDebug (hidden feature : double tap 2 times anywhere in Settings page to enable/disable)
- URL can be sent to Pebble Smartwatch 

What needs to be done :
- Add icons and splashscreens
- Include barcode
- Make the app invokable as a card 
- Make a 'Contact us' option (really easy, but totally forgot)
- Add qsTr() and tr() at some place + translations
- Make it prettier
